My project has no executable because it is a collection of assets and systems for unity that allow the user to create an executable. 

HOW TO OPEN:
Go to Unity and select my project folder to open.

HOW TO USE:
Open either the SampleScene, TomsScene or BraddsScene (last two are scenes created by my testers)
In the Scenes folder, there is a tutorial folder. This contains scenes which when run in unity show the user how to use the system and assets I've created.

NOTE ON TESTING:
The testers scenes were created solely by them without my help or guidance. All guidance came from my tutorials and them trying out different things. The only things I did give them was a plane to create their game on, the player asset and the base system assets such as the inventory system, pause/menu system and the other UI elements and event systems, which are not meant to be edited by the suers, and was not part of the system I want them to alter.
